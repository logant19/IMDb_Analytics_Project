## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring the publicly available IMDb datasets to analyze trends in movies, actors, and genres. The project consists of three main phases:

1. **Data Import**
   - Raw IMDb datasets (name basics, title basics, title principals, title episode, and title ratings) were imported into a SQL Server data warehouse.
   - Bronze tables store the raw data exactly as downloaded.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Cleaning involved removing placeholder values and standardizing formats to make the data easy to read.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Analysis performed on the cleaned datasets to extract insights, including:
     - Top genres by number of movies
     - Highest-rated genres and movies
     - Actor/crew statistics
     - Trends over time (release years, runtimes, ratings)
